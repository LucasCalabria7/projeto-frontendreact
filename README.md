## üìÑ Description
1. Home Page
    - The Main page will show a list of all available products for our e-commerce, with the updated data ( images, names and prices ); all of these products can be added to the cart clicking on the button "Buy Now".
    - The left side menu is the Filter Area. All products can be sorted by their names (A-Z/Z-A) or prices (Highest/ Lowest).
    - The right side menu allow the user to see all the items that were added to the cart; the bill's amount and the quantity of products. If you want to remove any item from that list is just click on the X button. If you want to proceed with the shopping, you can click on the "Payment" button that will take you to the payment page.
    - Using LocalStorage all products are saved; so if the user need to refresh the page, won't loose the cart.
    - At the top of the page, on the right side; the users can create their own account by clicking on "Create Account" button, this will take them to the LoginPage.

2. LoginPage
    - At the login page we can see the traditional inputs to create new accounts; we can see that are 5 inputs, each one for a data that the user has to complete (name, email, password and username).
    - All the inputs are being controlled by the handle functions and can be moved to a BackEnd interface easily.
    - All the inputs have their own requirements like, minimum length for usernames, same password and etc.

3. Payment Page 
    - At the Payment Page, a perfect simulation of a credit card registration. Where the user will fill the inputs with the credit card information and finalize the purchase.
    - All the inputs are being controlled by the handle functions and can be moved to a BackEnd interface easily.
